# üé≠ Face Recognition using TensorFlow

Welcome to our Face Recognition project powered by TensorFlow! üöÄ

## Project Overview

This repository contains the tools and resources for building a state-of-the-art face recognition system. Whether you're a data scientist, computer vision enthusiast, or security professional, this project offers valuable insights and practical implementations for facial recognition.

## Key Components

### üìì Notebooks
- **data_collect.ipynb**: Use this notebook to collect and preprocess face data for training purposes.
- **savedmodel.ipynb**: Train and save your custom face recognition model as `new_saved_model.keras`.
- **test.ipynb**: Deploy and test your trained model in real-time face recognition scenarios.

### üìÅ Files
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml**: A crucial file for face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
- **keras_model.h5**: Pre-trained face recognition model ready for deployment.
- **labels.txt**: Class labels for the recognized faces.
- **images/**: Additional images used for training or testing purposes.
- **LICENSE**: MIT License granting you the freedom to explore and innovate.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it. Dive in for more project insights!
